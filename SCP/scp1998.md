# SCP: series 1998

## Description
There are currently 44 data files.

They correspond to 11 bi-objective set covering problems.

For each problem, 4 variants are given: class A, B, C and D:

+ A: the costs are uniformly generated
+ B: created from A by replacing the second vector of costs by the first one in reverse order
+ C: vector of costs generated with plateaus of values
+ D: created from C by replacing the second vector of costs by the first one in reverse order


## Format
The format is originally from the OR library extended for handling multiple objectives.

The format of all of these data files is:

    number of rows (m), number of columns (n)   
    the cost of each column for objective 1 c1(j),j=1,...,n
    the cost of each column for objective 2 c2(j),j=1,...,n 
    for each row i (i=1,...,m): the number of columns which cover row i followed by a list of the columns which cover row i
