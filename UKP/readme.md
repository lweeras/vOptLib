# Multiobjective 01 unidimensional knapsack problem (UKP)
	
## Definition

The 01 unidimensional knapsack problem with $`p`$ linear objectives is defined as follow:

    Max sum{j=1,…,n} c^k_j x_j      for k = 1,…,p
    s/t sum{j=1,…,n} w_j x_j <= W
        x_j = 0 or 1                for j = 1,…,n
