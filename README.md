The Numerical Instances Library for MultiObjective Linear Optimization problems
==
	
MCDMlib is a collection of test data sets for a variety of Multiobjective optimization problems. 
Originaly the MCDMlib was dedicated to MultiObjective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) problems. 
Today the library covers several classes of MultiObjective Linear Optimization problems.
Since 2010, the MOCOlib is available from the MCDMlib section.
