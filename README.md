VOPTlib: Library of numerical instances for MultiObjective Linear Optimization problems
==
	
Created in 1998 and available online since, the library -originaly named MOCOlib- was dedicated to MultiObjective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) problems. 
Since 2010, it is refered from the International Society on Multiple Criteria Decision Making, section Digital Library:

Currently, VOPTlib covers a variety of Multiobjective linear optimization problems. 
It is organized in structured and non-structured classes of problems.
