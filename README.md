VOPTlib: Library for MultiObjective Linear Optimization problems
==
	
VOPTlib is a collection of test data sets for Multiobjective linear optimization problems. 

Created in 1998, available online since, and originaly named MOCOlib, the library was dedicated to MultiObjective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) problems. 
Since 2010, the library is refered from the International Society on Multiple Criteria Decision Making, section Digital Library:

Today, VOPTlib covers a variety of Multiobjective linear optimization problems. It is organized in structured and non-structured classes of problems.
