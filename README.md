VOPTlib: Library of numerical instances for MultiObjective Linear Optimization problems
==
	
About 
-- 
Created in 1998 and available online since, the library -originaly named MOCOlib- was dedicated to MultiObjective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) problems. 
It is referenced from the International Society on Multiple Criteria Decision Making at `http://www.mcdmsociety.org/`, section Digital Library.


The goal of VOPTlib (short for vector optimization library) is to provide problem instances for benchmarking multi-objective solvers.
Currently, VOPTlib covers a variety of Multiobjective linear optimization problems (multiobjective combinatorial, multiobjective integer linear, multiobjective mixed integer programs). 
It is organized in structured and non-structured problems.

Problem Classes
--
VOPTlib distinguishes the following problem classes:

Multi-objective combinatorial program 	moco 	Several linear objectives; feasible region is a convex polytope/polyhedron with a structure; all variables are restricted to be binary;

Multi-objective integer program 	moip 	Several linear objectives; feasible region is a convex polytope/polyhedron; all variables are restricted to be integer;

Multi-objective mixed integer program 	momip 	Several linear objectives; feasible region is a convex polytope/polyhedron; some but not all of the variables are restricted to be integer;
