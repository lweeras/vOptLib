# SPP: series SPP2002

There are currently 120 data files.
They correspond to 20 bi-objective set packing problems.

For each problem, 6 variants are given: class A, B, C, D, E and F.

+ A: the costs are uniformly generated
+ B: created from A by replacing the second vector of costs by the first one in reverse order
+ C: vector of costs generated with plateaus of values
+ D: created from C by replacing the second vector of costs by the first one in reverse order
+ E: one unicost objective and one randomly generated objective
+ F: one unicost objective and one randomly generated objective with plateaus of values

## Format
The format is originally from the OR library extended for handling multiple objectives.

The format of all of these data files is:

    number of rows (m), number of columns (n)
    the cost of each column for objective 1 c1(j),j=1,…,n
    the cost of each column for objective 2 c2(j),j=1,…,n
    for each row i (i=1,…,m): the number of columns which cover row i followed by a list of the columns which cover row i
